# check that a tuple cannot be changed in python 

a = (3 , 4 , 7 , 2 , 1)

print(a)

print(a[1])

a[1] = 6

print(a)

# with this example we checked that value in a tuple cannot be changed


# below example is of a list that can update/change the value
# b = [3 , 4 , 7 , 2 , 1]

# print(b)

# print(b[1])

# b[1] = 6

# print(b)
